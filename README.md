I recently worked on this Sales Overview dashboard that highlights our business's sales performance from 2019 to 2021. The dashboard includes:

Sales vs Budget: We achieved a sales total of $22,239,730, exceeding our budget by $1,139,730! 

Top 10 Products: Our best-selling products are led by the "Mountain" series, which dominates the sales chart.

Top 10 Customers: Key customers, including Jordan Turner and Maurice Shan, significantly contributed to our sales success.

Monthly Sales and Budget Trends: Visualizing the monthly sales trends against budget, helping us to identify peak periods and areas for improvement.

Sales by Product Category: The "Bikes" category is the major revenue driver, accounting for over 95% of our sales.

Geographical Sales Distribution: Mapping sales across various regions, with a strong presence in North America and Europe.

This dashboard is a powerful tool for tracking our progress and making informed business decisions.
